## Python Control Structures Quiz

This quiz is designed to test your understanding of Python's control structures, including conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while). Answer the following questions to assess your knowledge.

---

**Question 1:** What will be the output of the following code?

```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("Five is greater than three!")
```

1. Syntax Error
2. `True`
3. `False`
4. `Five is greater than three!`

**Answer:** 4. `Five is greater than three!`

---

**Question 2:** What does the `break` statement do in a loop?

1. Pauses the loop
2. Skips the current iteration
3. Exits the loop immediately
4. Does nothing

**Answer:** 3. Exits the loop immediately

---

**Question 3:** How many times will the following loop run?

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Looping!")
    count += 1
```

1. 4 times
2. 5 times
3. 6 times
4. Infinite times

**Answer:** 2. 5 times

---

**Question 4:** What will be the output of the following code?

```python
for i in range(3):
    if i == 2:
        break
    print(i)
```

1. `0 1 2`
2. `0 1`
3. `1 2`
4. `2`

**Answer:** 2. `0 1`

---

**Question 5:** Which of these is NOT a valid way to start a `for` loop in Python?

1. `for i in range(10):`
2. `for i in [1, 2, 3]:`
3. `for i < 10:`
4. `for i, value in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']):`

**Answer:** 3. `for i < 10:`

---

**Question 6:** What is the use of the `else` clause in Python loops?

1. To execute code after the loop completes normally (without `break`)
2. To handle errors in the loop
3. To define an alternative loop
4. To repeat the loop

**Answer:** 1. To execute code after the loop completes normally (without `break`)

---

**Question 7:** What will be the output of the following code?

```python
x = 0
while x < 4:
    x += 1
    if x == 2:
        continue
    print(x)
```

1. `1 2 3 4`
2. `1 3 4`
3. `2 3 4`
4. `1 2 3`

**Answer:** 2. `1 3 4`

---

**Question 8:** Which statement is true about a `while` loop in Python?

1. The `while` loop is used to iterate over a sequence.
2. The `while` loop runs until a specified condition is `False`.
3. The `while` loop cannot be used with `else`.
4. The `while` loop is faster than the `for` loop.

**Answer:** 2. The `while` loop runs until a specified condition is `False`.
