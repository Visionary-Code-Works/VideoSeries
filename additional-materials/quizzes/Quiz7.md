## Python Error and Exception Handling Quiz

This quiz focuses on your understanding of error and exception handling in Python. It covers various aspects including the usage of try-except blocks, raising exceptions, and handling different error types.

---

**Question 1:** What is the output of the following code?

```python
try:
    print("Hello")
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Divided by zero")
finally:
    print("This is executed last")
```

1. `Hello`
2. `Divided by zero`
3. `This is executed last`
4. `Hello`, `Divided by zero`, `This is executed last`

**Answer:** 4. `Hello`, `Divided by zero`, `This is executed last`

**Question 2:** How do you catch multiple exceptions in Python?

1. `except ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2:`
2. `except (ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2):`
3. `except ExceptionType1 or ExceptionType2:`
4. You cannot catch multiple exceptions.

**Answer:** 2. `except (ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2):`

**Question 3:** Which keyword is used to manually raise an exception in Python?

1. `throw`
2. `raise`
3. `error`
4. `exception`

**Answer:** 2. `raise`

---

**Question 4:** What is the purpose of the `finally` block in a try-except statement?

1. To execute code after the try block only if no exceptions were raised
2. To catch any exception that wasn't caught by previous except blocks
3. To execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not
4. To define an alternative code path if no exceptions were raised

**Answer:** 3. To execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not

---

**Question 5:** What does the following code do?

```python
try:
    # code that can raise an exception
except:
    print("An error occurred")
```

1. Catches all possible exceptions
2. Catches a specific exception
3. Raises an exception
4. Is a syntax error

**Answer:** 1. Catches all possible exceptions

---

**Question 6:** What happens if an exception is raised inside a function but not handled inside the function?

1. The function returns None
2. The program immediately exits
3. The exception propagates to the caller of the function
4. An infinite loop occurs

**Answer:** 3. The exception propagates to the caller of the function

---

**Question 7:** How do you ensure that a block of code is always executed, even if an exception occurs?

1. Put the code in the except block
2. Put the code in the finally block
3. Put the code before the try block
4. Wrap the code in another try-except block

**Answer:** 2. Put the code in the finally block

This quiz tests your knowledge of handling errors and exceptions in Python, which is essential for writing robust and error-resistant programs. Understanding how to properly manage exceptions allows you to maintain control over the flow of your program, even when unexpected issues arise.
