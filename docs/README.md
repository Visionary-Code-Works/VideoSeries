```python
# Example of classes and objects in Python

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.bark())
```

This script introduces the concept of classes and objects. It demonstrates how to define a class, create an object, and call its methods.

### Inheritance

```python
# Example of inheritance in Python

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says meow!"

# Creating an object of the Cat class
my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(my_cat.speak())
```

Here, the script showcases inheritance. The `Cat` class inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `speak` method.

### Polymorphism

```python
# Example of polymorphism in Python

class Bird(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says tweet!"

# Using polymorphism
animals = [Cat("Whiskers"), Bird("Tweety")]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
```

This part demonstrates polymorphism, where different classes have a common interface (`speak` method). It shows how the same method can perform different functions based on the object calling it.

### Special Methods (Dunder Methods)

```python
# Example of special methods in Python

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"

# Creating an object of the Book class
my_book = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
print(my_book)
```

The script introduces special methods, also known as dunder (double underscore) methods, like `__str__`. It shows how to define and use them to customize the behavior of objects.

These examples should be complemented with explanations in the video tutorials, helping viewers to grasp the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Python.

## Part 8: Error Handling and Exceptions in Python

**Objective**: Teach how to handle errors and exceptions in Python to ensure robust code.

### Understanding Exceptions

```python
# Example of understanding exceptions in Python

try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("You entered:", number)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a number!")
```

This script introduces the concept of exceptions. It uses a `try` block to attempt to convert user input to an integer and an `except` block to catch a `ValueError` if the input is not a number.

### Try, Except, Finally Blocks

```python
# Example of try, except, finally blocks in Python

try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found.")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")
```

Here, the script demonstrates the use of `finally` block, which executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It ensures resources like files are properly closed.

### Creating Custom Exceptions

```python
# Example of creating custom exceptions in Python

class NegativeNumberError(Exception):
    """Exception raised for negative numbers."""
    pass

def square_root(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise NegativeNumberError("Cannot find the square root of a negative number.")
    return number ** 0.5

try:
    result = square_root(-4)
    print("Square root is:", result)
except NegativeNumberError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

This script shows how to define a custom exception (`NegativeNumberError`) and use it in a function (`square_root`). It demonstrates raising an exception when a specific condition is met.

### Error Handling Best Practices

Discuss the best practices in error handling, like not using bare `except` statements, using specific exceptions, and the importance of cleaning up resources in the `finally` block.

These examples, along with explanations in the video tutorials, will help learners understand how to effectively handle errors and exceptions in Python, an essential skill for writing reliable and robust code.
