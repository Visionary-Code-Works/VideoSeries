# Basic Syntax and Conventions in Python

## **1. Python Syntax:**

- Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Consistent spacing (commonly 4 spaces per indentation level) is crucial.
- Statements in Python typically end with a new line, and no semicolons are required.
- Comments start with `#`, and anything after `#` on a line is ignored by Python.

## **2. Naming Conventions:**

- Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability (e.g., `my_variable`).
- Class names should follow the CapWords convention (e.g., `MyClass`).
- Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

## **3. Python Identifiers:**

- An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other objects.
- It should start with a letter (A to Z or a to z) or an underscore (`_`) followed by letters, underscores, or digits (0 to 9).

## **4. Importing Modules:**

- Modules can be imported using the `import` statement (e.g., `import math`).
- Specific attributes or functions can be imported using the `from` keyword (e.g., `from math import sqrt`).

## **5. Basic Output:**

- The `print()` function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).
- Example: `print("Hello, World!")`

## **6. Reading Input:**

- The `input()` function allows user input.
- Example: `name = input("Enter your name: ")`
