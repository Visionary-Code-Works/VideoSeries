# Part 02

For Part 02 of the Python series, which typically focuses on "Data Types and Structures," the following files would be appropriate to include:

1. **Code Examples (Directory: `code-examples/`):**
   - `data_types.py`: Demonstrates Python's various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
   - `string_manipulation.py`: Examples of common string manipulation techniques in Python.
   - `list_operations.py`: Shows how to perform various operations on lists, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.
   - `tuple_examples.py`: Demonstrates the use of tuples and how they differ from lists.
   - `set_operations.py`: Code examples showcasing operations on sets, such as union, intersection, and difference.
   - `dictionary_usage.py`: Illustrates how to create, access, and manipulate dictionaries.

2. **Notes (Directory: `notes/`):**
   - `UnderstandingDataTypes.md`: A document explaining the basic data types in Python and their characteristics.
   - `WorkingWithStrings.md`: Notes on string manipulation and common string methods.
   - `ListsTuplesAndSets.md`: A comprehensive overview of lists, tuples, and sets in Python, including their differences and use-cases.
   - `DictionariesInDepth.md`: Detailed notes on dictionaries, including key-value pairs, accessing data, and dictionary comprehensions.

3. **Resources (Directory: `resources/`):**
   - `AdditionalReadingLinks.md`: A collection of links to external resources and documentation for deeper understanding of data types and structures in Python.
   - `PracticalExercises.md`: Suggested practical exercises and problems to solve, focusing on data types and structures.

4. **Exercises (Directory: `exercises/`):**
   - `DataStructuresExercises.py`: A set of exercises for practicing the use of various data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

5. **Quizzes (Directory: `quizzes/`):**
   - `Quiz2.md`: A short quiz to test understanding of Python data types and structures.

Each of these files should be tailored to provide comprehensive and beginner-friendly content on Python's data types and structures. This setup ensures that learners not only understand the theoretical aspects but also get hands-on practice through code examples and exercises.
