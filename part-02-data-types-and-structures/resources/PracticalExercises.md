# Practical Exercises for Python Data Structures

This document provides a series of practical exercises focusing on Python's data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. These exercises are designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency with these fundamental concepts.

## **1. List Manipulation**

- **Exercise**: Create a list of five numbers. Write a Python script to do the following:
  - Add a new number to the end of the list.
  - Remove the second number in the list.
  - Insert a new number at the beginning of the list.
  - Print the final list.

## **2. Tuple Creation and Operations**

- **Exercise**: Create a tuple with different data types (integer, string, float). Then, try to change one of the elements in the tuple to see what happens. Finally, slice the tuple to get a subset and print it.

## **3. Set Comparisons**

- **Exercise**: Given two sets, `set1 = {1, 2, 3}` and `set2 = {2, 3, 4}`, perform the following operations:
  - Find the union and intersection of the two sets.
  - Determine if `set1` is a subset of `set2`.
  - Create a third set with elements that are in `set1` but not in `set2`.

## **4. Working with Dictionaries**

- **Exercise**: Create a dictionary to store information about a person (name, age, and city). Perform the following tasks:
  - Add a new key-value pair for the person's occupation.
  - Update the age of the person.
  - Remove the city information from the dictionary.
  - Print the final state of the dictionary.

## **5. Data Structure Conversion**

- **Exercise**: Convert the following list to a set and a tuple, and print each: `my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`. Notice the change in data structure, especially with the set.

## **6. Nested Data Structures**

- **Exercise**: Create a nested dictionary to represent a book. The dictionary should include the book's title, author, publication year, and a list of chapter titles. Access and print the title of the third chapter.

## **7. List Comprehension**

- **Exercise**: Use list comprehension to create a list of squares for all even numbers between 1 and 10. Print the resulting list.

## **8. Dictionary Manipulation**

- **Exercise**: Given a dictionary of stock prices: `{"Apple": 116, "Google": 148, "Microsoft": 210}`, write a script to increase each price by 10% and print the updated dictionary.

## **9. Complex Data Structures**

- **Exercise**: Create a list where each element is a dictionary representing a student. Each dictionary should include the student's name and their list of grades. Calculate the average grade for each student and print their name alongside their average grade.

## **10. Set Operations Challenge**

- **Exercise**: Create a set of prime numbers less than 20 and another set of odd numbers less than 20. Find the symmetric difference between the two sets and print it.

These exercises are designed to be progressively challenging, ensuring that you not only understand the syntax but also how to apply these data structures in different scenarios. They are a great way to practice Python and become comfortable with everyday programming tasks involving lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
