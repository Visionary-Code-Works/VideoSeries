# Part 03

For Part 03 of the Python series, which typically focuses on "Control Structures," the following files would be relevant to include:

1. **Code Examples (Directory: `code-examples/`):**
   - `if_else_examples.py`: Examples demonstrating the use of if-else and elif statements.
   - `for_loop_examples.py`: Demonstrates the use of for loops, including iterating over lists, ranges, and strings.
   - `while_loop_examples.py`: Examples of while loops, including basic loops and loops with break and continue statements.
   - `nested_loops.py`: Shows how to use nested loops in Python.

2. **Notes (Directory: `notes/`):**
   - `UnderstandingControlStructures.md`: A document explaining the concept of control structures in Python, including conditional statements and loops.
   - `ConditionalStatementsInDepth.md`: Detailed notes on using if, elif, and else statements.
   - `LoopingTechniques.md`: Comprehensive notes covering for and while loops, including their syntax and practical applications.

3. **Resources (Directory: `resources/`):**
   - `UsefulLinks.md`: A collection of links to external resources, tutorials, and documentation on control structures in Python.
   - `FurtherReading.md`: Suggestions for additional reading material or online courses focusing on control structures.

4. **Exercises (Directory: `exercises/`):**
   - `ControlStructuresExercises.py`: A set of exercises for practicing the use of if-else statements, for loops, and while loops.

5. **Quizzes (Directory: `quizzes/`):**
   - `Quiz3.md`: A quiz to test understanding of control structures, including conditional statements and different types of loops.

Each of these files should be designed to provide an in-depth and practical understanding of control structures in Python, helping learners to write more dynamic and efficient code.
