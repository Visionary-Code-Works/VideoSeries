## Python Object-Oriented Programming Quiz

This quiz is designed to assess your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It covers classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

**Question 1:** What is the correct way to define a class in Python?

1. `class MyClass(){}`
2. `def MyClass():`
3. `class MyClass:`
4. `new MyClass:`

**Answer:** 3. `class MyClass:`

---

**Question 2:** How do you create an instance of a class named `MyClass`?

1. `instance = MyClass()`
2. `instance = new MyClass()`
3. `instance = create MyClass()`
4. `instance = class MyClass()`

**Answer:** 1. `instance = MyClass()`

**Question 3:** What is the method inside a class that is called when an object is instantiated?

1. `__init__`
2. `__start__`
3. `__create__`
4. `__new__`

**Answer:** 1. `__init__`

---

**Question 4:** In Python, how do you define a method that belongs to a class?

1. By defining a function inside a class
2. By declaring a function outside of the class
3. By using the `static` keyword before a function
4. By using the `@classmethod` decorator

**Answer:** 1. By defining a function inside a class

**Question 5:** Which keyword is used for inheritance in Python?

1. `extends`
2. `inherits`
3. `super`
4. `class`

**Answer:** 4. `class` (e.g., `class SubClass(SuperClass):`)

---

**Question 6:** How do you call a method from a parent class in Python?

1. `super().method()`
2. `parent.method()`
3. `base.method()`
4. `SuperClass.method()`

**Answer:** 1. `super().method()`

---

**Question 7:** Which of these statements about polymorphism is true?

1. Polymorphism allows methods to perform different operations based on the object type.
2. Polymorphism is only possible through inheritance.
3. Polymorphism can be achieved only by overloading methods.
4. Polymorphism is not supported in Python.

**Answer:** 1. Polymorphism allows methods to perform different operations based on the object type.

---

**Question 8:** What is encapsulation in Python?

1. The inclusion of multiple classes in a single module
2. The binding of data and methods that manipulate that data within a class
3. The concept of inheriting properties from another class
4. The ability to change the behavior of a method in a derived class

**Answer:** 2. The binding of data and methods that manipulate that data within a class

This quiz is intended to evaluate your grasp of OOP principles in Python, a paradigm that provides a means of structuring your code in a way that bundles data and operations on data and facilitates code reuse and organization. Understanding OOP is crucial for building complex and efficient Python applications.
