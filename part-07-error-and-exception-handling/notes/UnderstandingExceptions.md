## Understanding Exceptions in Python

Exceptions are a key aspect of Python programming, providing a way to handle errors gracefully and maintain the normal flow of the program. This document explains what exceptions are and their importance in Python.

**1. What is an Exception?**

- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
- In Python, exceptions are triggered by errors in code or by unexpected conditions.

**2. Common Python Exceptions:**

- `SyntaxError`: Occurs when the parser encounters a syntax error.
- `IndexError`: Happens when trying to access an index that is not in a sequence.
- `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
- `TypeError`: Thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
- `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument with the right type but an inappropriate value.

**3. Why Handle Exceptions?**

- Handling exceptions allows a program to respond appropriately to errors.
- It prevents the program from crashing and allows the execution of alternative or corrective actions.

**4. The Impact of Unhandled Exceptions:**

- An unhandled exception will stop the execution of the program, which can lead to loss of data or other undesirable outcomes.

**5. How Python Handles Exceptions:**

- Python provides a way to write error-handling code using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` statements.
