## Using Try, Except, and Finally Blocks in Python

Error handling in Python can be accomplished through the use of `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. These structures provide a way to catch and respond to exceptions.

**1. The `try` Block:**

- The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- Syntax:

     ```python
     try:
         # Code that may cause an exception
     ```

**2. The `except` Block:**

- The `except` block lets you handle the error.
- It can be used to catch specific exceptions or all exceptions.
- Syntax:

     ```python
     except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
         # Code to handle the exception
     ```

**3. The `finally` Block:**

- The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
- Commonly used for cleanup actions.
- Syntax:

     ```python
     finally:
         # Code that runs no matter what
     ```

**4. Using Multiple `except` Blocks:**

- You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g., if you want to execute a different block of code for each exception type.

**5. Raising Exceptions:**

- You can raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword, often used to force a specified exception to occur.
