## Advanced File Operations in Python

For more complex file handling needs, Python offers advanced functionalities that include file seeking, handling binary files, and efficiently managing large files.

---

**1. File Seeking**

- **Purpose**: To change the file objectâ€™s position.
- **Methods**: `file_object.seek(offset, from_what)`
- **Use-cases**: Random access in files, such as in binary files.

**2. Working with Binary Files**

- **Reading/Writing**: Open the file in binary mode (`'rb'` or `'wb'`).
- **Handling**: Use binary data handling methods like `struct` for reading/writing structured binary data.

**3. Handling Large Files**

- **Reading in Chunks**: Instead of reading the whole file at once, read it in chunks or line by line.
- **Example**:

     ```python
     with open("large_file.txt", "r") as file:
         while True:
             chunk = file.read(1024)
             if not chunk:
                 break
             process(chunk)
     ```

**4. Temporary Files**

- **Use-case**: Creating temporary files and directories using the `tempfile` module.
- **Advantages**: Automatic cleanup, secure temporary file creation.

**5. File Compression**

- **Modules**: `gzip`, `bz2`, `zipfile` for compressing and decompressing files.

- **Usage**: Useful for reducing file size and archiving multiple files.

These notes provide a solid foundation for both basic and advanced file operations in Python, empowering you to handle a wide range of file types and data processing tasks.
