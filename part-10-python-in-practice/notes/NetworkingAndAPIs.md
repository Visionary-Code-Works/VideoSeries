## Networking and API Interactions in Python

Python's standard library and third-party modules make it a great language for networking tasks and interacting with APIs. This document explores Python's capabilities in these areas.

---

**1. HTTP Requests**

- Python’s `requests` library simplifies HTTP requests, making it easy to interact with RESTful APIs.
- It supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods.

**2. Parsing JSON**

- Python easily handles JSON data, commonly returned by web APIs.
- The `json` module in Python’s standard library allows for parsing JSON into Python objects and vice versa.

**3. Web Scraping**

- Libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are used for web scraping – extracting data from websites.
- Python’s tools can parse and extract data from HTML and XML.

**4. Socket Programming**

- Python’s `socket` library allows for low-level network interactions.
- It can be used to create clients and servers, send and receive messages over TCP/IP and UDP.

**5. Integrating with Cloud Services**

- Python interfaces well with cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- SDKs like Boto3 for AWS provide Pythonic ways to interact with cloud services.
