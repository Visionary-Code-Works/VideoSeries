**1. Decorators Exercise**

- **Task**: Create a decorator that times the execution of a function and prints the duration.
- **Objective**: Understand and implement decorators to modify the behavior of functions.

**2. Generators and Iterators Exercise**

- **Task**: Write a generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers and a script to print the first 10 numbers from it.
- **Objective**: Practice creating and using generators and iterators.

**3. Asynchronous Programming Exercise**

- **Task**: Use `asyncio` to write a simple asynchronous program that performs multiple web requests concurrently.
- **Objective**: Gain a basic understanding of asynchronous programming in Python.

**4. Advanced Data Structures Exercise**

- **Task**: Implement a function using `collections.namedtuple` or `collections.defaultdict` and demonstrate its utility.
- **Objective**: Learn to use advanced data structures from Python's `collections` module.

**5. Regular Expressions Advanced Exercise**

- **Task**: Write a script using regular expressions to parse a log file and extract dates and error levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
- **Objective**: Practice advanced pattern matching with regular expressions.

**6. Context Managers Exercise**

- **Task**: Create a context manager for handling a resource (e.g., opening a file, connecting to a database).
- **Objective**: Understand the concept and implementation of context managers for resource management.

**7. Metaclasses and Class Creation Exercise**

- **Task**: Use a metaclass to modify the behavior of a class (e.g., add a new method or modify existing ones).
- **Objective**: Explore advanced OOP concepts, particularly metaclasses.

**8. Memory Management Exercise**

- **Task**: Write a script that creates a large number of objects and uses weak references to monitor object creation and deletion.
- **Objective**: Understand Python's memory management and garbage collection.

**9. Advanced File Handling Exercise**

- **Task**: Implement a script to read a large CSV file in chunks and process each chunk separately.
- **Objective**: Learn to handle large files efficiently in Python.

**10. Python C Extension Exercise**

- **Task** (Advanced): Create a simple Python C extension module that defines a function for a basic operation (e.g., adding two numbers).
- **Objective**: Get a basic understanding of integrating Python with C for performance improvements.
