## Mastering Asynchronous Programming in Python

This document provides an in-depth look at asynchronous programming in Python, exploring event loops, coroutines, and their usage in writing efficient, non-blocking code.

---

**1. Asynchronous Programming**

- **Definition**: A form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread.
- **Advantages**: Improves application performance and responsiveness.

**2. Event Loops**

- **Concept**: The core of every asyncio application, used to schedule and run asynchronous tasks.
- **Usage**: Handling events, IO operations, and executing asynchronous code.

**3. Coroutines**

- **Definition**: Functions whose execution can be paused and resumed.
- **`async` and `await`**: Python keywords for defining and calling coroutines.
- **Practical Examples**: Writing and running asynchronous functions.
