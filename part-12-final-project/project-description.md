# Final Project

1. **Project Description (File: `project-description.md`):**
   - **Overview**: A detailed description of the final project, outlining its objectives, scope, and expected outcomes.
   - **Requirements**: Specific requirements or features that the project should implement, such as data handling, user input, network communication, etc.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: The criteria against which the project will be evaluated, such as code quality, functionality, adherence to requirements, and documentation.

2. **Starter Code (Directory: `starter-code/`):**
   - Contains initial code files that provide a starting point for the project. This can include basic setup, utility functions, or a framework that students will build upon.
   - **Example Files**:
     - `main.py`: A starter Python script with the main application structure.
     - `utilities.py`: Some common functions that might be useful for the project.
     - `requirements.txt`: A list of external libraries required for the project.

3. **Solution (Directory: `solution/`):**
   - **Solution Code**: The completed project code, serving as a reference. This should only be consulted after attempting the project.
     - **Example Files**:
       - `complete_main.py`: The fully implemented main script.
       - `additional_modules/`: Any additional Python files created for the solution.
   - **Walkthrough.md**: A document explaining the solution, key decisions, and why certain approaches were taken.

4. **Resources (Directory: `resources/`):**
   - **Learning Resources**: Links to resources that can help in completing the project, such as documentation for libraries used, tutorials, or guides.
   - **Further Reading**: Additional materials for those who want to explore more advanced or related topics.

5. **README.md**:
   - **Instructions**: Detailed instructions on how to approach the project, including setup, development, testing, and submission guidelines.
   - **Tips and Hints**: Helpful suggestions or hints that can guide students in solving complex parts of the project without giving away the solution.

This structure for the "Final Project" section is designed to provide a comprehensive and practical experience. It should challenge learners to apply the skills they've acquired throughout the series, test their problem-solving abilities, and encourage them to explore and experiment with their own creative solutions.


Given the specific focus of the final project on building a web-based data dashboard using Flask, Pandas, and Plotly, the project structure would be slightly different to incorporate the specific technologies and steps involved. Here's how the structure could be adapted:

### Final Project: Web-Based Data Dashboard

1. **Project Description (File: `project-description.md`):**
   - **Overview**: An introduction to the project, explaining the goal of building a data dashboard using Flask, Pandas, and Plotly.
   - **Requirements**: Detailed list of features and functionalities expected in the dashboard, such as data fetching, processing, visualization, and web interface.

2. **Starter Code (Directory: `starter-code/`):**
   - Basic templates and scripts to help get started with the project.
   - **Example Files**:
     - `app.py`: A starter Flask application script.
     - `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages (Flask, Pandas, Plotly, requests).
     - `templates/`: Basic HTML templates for the dashboard.
     - `static/`: Directory for static files like CSS and JavaScript.

3. **Solution (Directory: `solution/`):**
   - **Complete Project Code**: The fully developed project as a reference.
   - **Walkthrough.md**: Explains the implementation details, key programming decisions, and how different parts of the project work together.

4. **Testing and Debugging (Directory: `testing/`):**
   - **Unit Tests**: Sample unit tests for different components of the project.
   - **Debugging Guide**: Tips and strategies for debugging the application.

5. **Resources (Directory: `resources/`):**
   - **API Documentation**: Links to the documentation of the API used for fetching data.
   - **Flask, Pandas, and Plotly Resources**: Tutorials and documentation for Flask, Pandas, and Plotly.

6. **README.md**:
   - **Project Setup**: Instructions on setting up the project environment, including installing dependencies.
   - **Running the Application**: Steps on how to run the Flask app and access the dashboard.
   - **Deployment Tips**: (Optional) Basic guidance on how to deploy the dashboard on a web server or a platform like Heroku.

7. **Additional Files (Optional):**
   - `data_processing.py`: A separate Python script for more complex data processing tasks.
   - `visualization.py`: Script for creating more complex Plotly visualizations.

This structure ensures that the final project is comprehensive, covering all aspects of building a data dashboard, from backend development to frontend presentation. It provides learners with an opportunity to apply various skills learned throughout the Python series in a practical, real-world project.
