# Flask Tutorial for the Web-Based Data Dashboard

## Introduction

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to Flask, a web framework for Python, which is used in the Web-Based Data Dashboard project.

## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

## Setting Up Flask

1. **Install Flask**:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Hello World Application**:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run()
   ```

## Basic Concepts

- **Routes**: Define URLs to different parts of your application.
- **Templates**: Enable dynamic HTML rendering.
- **Static Files**: Serve CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## Building a Simple Application

1. **Create a route**:
   Define a function and attach it to a URL.
2. **Return HTML**:
   You can return HTML directly from your routes.
3. **Using Templates**:
   Create dynamic HTML pages using the Jinja2 template engine.

## Debugging

- Flask provides a built-in development server with a debugger.
- Run your app with `app.run(debug=True)` to enable the debugger.
