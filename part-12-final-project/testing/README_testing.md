# Testing Documentation: Web-Based Data Dashboard

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing strategies and practices used in the Web-Based Data Dashboard project.

## Testing Framework

- We use unittest, a built-in Python testing framework, for writing and running tests.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s testing
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new code.
- Follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for structuring tests.
- Mock external services to isolate the system under test.

## Test Coverage

- Aim for a high percentage of test coverage.
- Use coverage tools to identify untested parts of the code.

## Reporting Issues

- If you find any bugs or issues, report them using the project's issue tracker.

## Conclusion

Testing is a crucial part of our development process, ensuring the reliability and quality of the application.
